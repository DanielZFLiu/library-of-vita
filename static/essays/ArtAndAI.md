# Art, Aesthetic Value, and AI

## 1

What do we find beautiful? A promise of the eternal: something higher, something transcendent, something outside of us, something that *lasts*. This motivation has its roots in evolution. Our desire to replicate, to reproduce, and by extension to carry on and to preserve – this manifests in our psyche, and thus in society. We see this: judges who were reminded of death before judgement gave harsher sentences, older people tend to be more conservative, one’s pride in their own culture and discrimination towards others, education of children that reflect parents; and the list goes on.

There is certainly more to aesthetics than the pure evolutionary drive of survival, even a pure materialist shouldn’t deny this. Our drives and desires are products of evolution, but as things are in evolution, nothing comes out clean. This greedy algorithm is the most efficient way of replication, but not the most optimal way of design, and features tend to come with byproducts, or outlast their use. The human phenomenon has a single cause, but no single effect. Thus, complexity erupts from a simplistic root of survival: curiosity, love, strength of will; and we are able to glance upon the starry night with a sense of wonder and awe.

A crude artist is but a mouthpiece, the soil for an ideal, a naïve ensemble of ideas. The master artist is one who uses art to express their own will, where techniques and themes serve their purpose; every stroke, color, outline, shape expresses *intention*. In this sense, AI art is crude, as there is little to no choice behind details; the abomination of physics, often seen in these arts, is but a surface phenomenon of art devoid of intention.

In this sense, stable diffusion is incapable of producing intentful art. The model lacks consciousness to choose, with precision, what to accomplish in an art piece. The scaling of a mechanism to unblur random gaussian noise produces art that passes for art on average, but an average of choices is no choice; this becomes the ultimate limit of stable diffusion and even large language models—the inability to truly be exceptional.

The effect of the artistic intent goes beyond a mere judgement. Why do we entertain escapism? Cowardice? No, of course not. It isn’t children’s naivety that drives us to art. We see what we lack, what we need, what we desire and *will*; we read adventure with a daring spirit, magic as an exploration of wonder, and mystery to sate our curiosity for the unknown; our admiration for these aspects, or the lack thereof, drives us to art, where we briefly find peace and reprise from the void of reality.

But a person who actively enjoys art and fiction is still a hundred folds ahead of one who accepts the emptiness of life, as a person who faces their own will is, fundamentally, closer to realizing it than the person who denies it altogether. We escape so we can see our will outside ourselves, before realizing it within; that is the true value of art—the ability to inspire and cultivate.

A friend recently pointed out the contrast between Computer Science and Art: artists are more protective of their work, whereas the ideal programmer takes pleasure in open-sourcing their code. This notion is perhaps a bit exaggerated. Programmers wish for innovation or engineering upon the open-sourced project; but they share the detestation towards a malicious party that copies and claims the work as their own. Further noted, artists do share their work, they simply discourage outright plagiarism. However, we shouldn’t deny that a gap does exist.

Innovation does not grow from pure chaos. In a sense, when law and order restrict our axis of freedom, we are given no choice but to internalize unfulfilled desires; much of art is the outlet of the beast inside. The emergence of copyright has some of the same roots, as it allows people to share without worry of parasite: thus structure gives rise to a platform, where innovation stems. A right balance of copyright maintenance benefits the creators and society. However, it is not certain which degree of copyright law is optimal, and we see programmers on the softer side of this structure; they forfeit much of their copyright through open source, yet we still see innovation aplenty, with an acceptable degree of parasitic behaviors. The same doesn’t necessarily apply to the Arts: where programming tends to be modular, art is not; individuals don’t innovate by concatenating a new permutation of existing art works. A lighter copyright system does not benefit Art.

We see this divide magnified in the matter of AI. Both code and art were used in the training of AI without consent, both Stable Diffusion and LLMs were purported to threaten job security of artists and programmers, yet only one side raised lawsuits against relevant AI companies. I should point out that the process of learning from an array of artworks is not in and of itself wrong, as the average artist does the same. What is wrong is that Stable Diffusion models are not sufficiently conscious. This necessarily means that: 1. They do not produce intentful arts, as previously analyzed, and 2. They are controlled by capitalists, who use them to profit, and thus threaten the artist’s livelihood. In fact, imagine a sufficiently intelligent and conscious AI, a free agent, trained on artworks and able to produce intentful art; I’d imagine the same gripes don’t apply. Nevertheless, the protest is in general warranted, even if it’s just for 2.

Regardless of the morality of pretraining AI, it isn’t the case that the usage of AI follows the same conclusion. The societal usage of AI simulates a large-scale prisoner’s dilemma. Each person has a choice to make: whether to use AI or not. If a sufficiently critical mass of people declines to use AI, the capitalist would forfeit control on the direction of AI, as there is little profit; and perhaps AI under pure research is a better way forward. However, using AI provides a competitive advantage to users (or appears to), which means that there will always be a critical number of AI users. Consequentially, an individual’s decision—given that they hold no significant sway over the masses—to use AI has no impact whatsoever, and it does not matter either way.

Given that an individual has little sway over the direction of AI development, the optimal thing to do is to use AI positively. AI has many benefits that are slowly emerging: serving as a personal (albeit error-prone) tutor, acting as a sampling machine to provide inspiration, and becoming a one-size-fits-all duct tape to dynamic systems. A blind hatred towards this tool accomplishes nothing; when we face the scale of risks vs benefits, the ethical decision is to add weight to the right side.
