# Free Will

### 1

The human will isn’t free. This should not be a revelation – perhaps the best case against free will is the sheer *amount* of anti-Free-Will evidence or argumentation; from Soon, Bode, and Haynes’ experiments[^1] to the Hungry Judge Effect[^2] to Toxoplasma Gondii and Phineas Gage[^3]; among philosophers: Nietzsche[^4], Schopenhauer[^5], Leucippus[^6], Spinoza[^7], and Laplace[^8].  Some of these results are so influential that they have seeped into the public consciousness; for example, most acknowledge - to some degree - that genetics affects our propensity for certain decisions[^9], and that trauma may affect emotional control[^10]. Some can also be obtained individually: those who meditate often observe the spontaneous appearance of thoughts inside.  

Furthermore, the libertarian free will - the idea that given an action, a person could have done otherwise - is not only a false one, but a self contradictory one. If the world is deterministic, then by causality all sequence of events has been fixed: dried, framed, and nailed to the wall[^11]. Even if it’s not deterministic, it still must be probabilistic, either completely random, or statistically predictable - not a slave to causality, but a slave to probabilities instead. No combination of deterministic and indeterministic cause would be sufficient either, for the combination of the reasons provided above. To justify such an idea, you would have to assume the individual human brain/essence/soul as an uncaused cause, indeterministic yet not probabilistic, separate from causality yet still able to influence reality – a truly absurd, and self contradictory, notion. 

The root of the contradiction lies in the conception of "free". We started worshipping freedom *because* it was unintelligible (we do have a propensity to do so, instead of leaving them unknown). In truth, there is no such thing as libertarian freedom; and the feeling of freedom – every instance of it - falls somewhere between the scale of determinism to absolute randomness, where the end of both sides signifies a *complete nonexistence of freedom*. Worse, what one means by freedom could differ drastically from another, and often, the individual that brought up the concept are merely invoking the image of a favourable outcome. This ambiguous concept - we are better off without it!

What are we left with? *"How do we salvage this barren wasteland?"* The resolution is simply - we don’t, because little of consequence has occurred. Aside from the trivial point - that no matter your stance on free will, you will still wake up in the morning and act like you have it – it is also the case that an individual feels the most free when they get to express and follow their will. That is, I claim, the only coherent idea one can rescue from libertarian free will. There was nothing more, nothing less to begin with. 

The idea of being able to choose otherwise is but an idea that came from western religion, and contrary to popular beliefs, a self-consistent moral system does not need to depend on it. Law and punishment existed long before free will, and punishment did not originate as retribution, justified because they (who have wronged you) could have chosen otherwise; no, it was (i) a form of containment for social stability, (ii) a compensation for the injured party (to prevent a vicious cycle), and (iii) a warning to inspire fear and deter crime... Kind or deplorable acts existed just fine (locally, for the moral relativists out there); a person who commits murder for the fun of it is reprehensible irregardless of whether they could have chosen otherwise, because that action is *morally reprehensible*[^12]. One’s pain from knowing this – if they do exist – is nothing but of a lie believed and revealed, and it will be gone in due time.

Perhaps the only change comes not in the form of decay, but of kindness. There was once a time when we thought that a bad storm was due to cursed witch, and schizophrenia was the fault of the parents who raised the child. The realization of cosmicism humbled us, removing much arrogance from moral considerations. The crumbling of freedom should do the same, as we understand that the world is not so full of evil, but unfavourable environments, wrong trajectories, and pure chance. A door opens, one full of possibilities, of rehabilitation, of cultivation. And so, I say, *good riddance*.

[^11]: An interesting counter argument points out that the essence of cause and time – entropy - is merely an abstraction, a blurred vision, as Carlo Rovelli called it; there is no distinction between cause and effect in elementary physics, only symmetry. However, one must realize that we live in the blurred world, our body and mind goes in the direction of cause then effect - even if that is only an emergent phenomenon - and thus is our thoughts and decision and will.
